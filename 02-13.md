# Normalization
* Very important topic for database administrators!
* which set of attributes can uniquely identify the tuple?
* Primary key + Candidate Key
* Candidate Keys are keys that can uniquely identify the tuple
  * the one you choose to use is called the **Primary Key**
* _Choosing Primary Key is first thing you should do!_
* **First Normal Form:** A relation is in first normal form if and only if the domain of each attribute contains only atomic (indivisible) values, and the value of each attribute contains only a single value from that domain.
  * if the primary key is defined correctly, such that it uniquely determines all attributes (entire tuple).
  * known as `1NF`
* if you don't have your primary key correctly defined, your table is not in **1NF**

Partial Dependency!

* Follow partial dependencies to do **decomposition**.
* first normal form is used to compose tables in second normal form
  * this is done by removing partial dependencies.

## topics covered
* candidate key
* anomaly
  * update anomaly
  * deletion anomaly
  * insertion anomaly
* 1st normal form
* functional dependency
* decomposition
* partial dependency
* 2nd normal form
