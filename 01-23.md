## SQL Intro
* SQL has been around a long time (50 years or so)
* Microsoft came along and purchased SQL Server, put their name on it

### Query Framework
* `SELECT` specifies which _columns_ are to be listed in the query results.
* `FROM` specifies which _tables_ are to be used in the query.
* `WHERE` specifies which _rows_ are to be listed in the query results.
* comments go between `/*` and `*/`
* SQL query statements are terminated by a semicolon `;`
  * some tools let you omit the semicolon but it's good practice to leave it in
* The asterisk `*` symbol acts as a wildcard and will select all columns
* `ORDER_BY` will sort results by the specified key (column)
  * add multiple keys to sort by seperated by commas `,`
  * default sort method is descending, but you can specify to use ascending order
